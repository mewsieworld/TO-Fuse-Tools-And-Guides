These are based around recoloring vanilla sprites. Some are admittedly poorly made.

I'm Mewsie or better known as Mewzie or Happy (my fuse creator name) on epTO.
I'm releasing my custom fuses I have made, and some I never released, for free. (Google Drive Link)
I do not have the configuration files for this made, yet, as they were made for me and I'm still learning how to do so from scratch.

However, the nri's are there, the raw bmp's are there, as well as icons and showcases for your patchnotes for each fuse.

Not all of these are winners, but some are okay looking!

These are otherwise currently exclusive to PoppuriTO (as epTO shut down and got their files taken by that server by former epTO staff [long story]), but information was meant to be free, and so was the accessibility of these fuses. Also PoppuriTO made me into a male NPC [Happyisto Stalone] and I'm still bitter about it.

# Potential Questions:

1. How do I add these to my server?
- Honestly I'm not sure yet LMAO, I'll update this when I figure out how to do it myself

2. How do I add the configuration files for the server-side client
- See Question 1 I'm so sorry :(

3. How do I add these to the database
- See Question 1 I'm so sorry :(

4. How did you make these?
- First I extracted the originals from the existing *.nri files using TNT, then combed through the databases or files themselves and found the matching icons and frames for the images. I was "lazy" on looking for the illustrations, so instead, I opted to make fun, custom ones. You will see some are really silly :) I had fun with them. These were then exported to bmp (v2; 24-bit) via photoshop, imported using a GM fuse tool (provided by epTO), arranged in the right frame order/position, and then exported as a 24-bit .nri. I then seperated them into the appropriate folders for you (or maybe not upon second glance? I messed up a few times--you might want to double check; will fix later), by equip and item, for the frames, icons, and portraits.

5. Can I use these without credit?
- It's the internet, I don't expect you to use credit. However, any shoutout is greatly appreciated ❤️ Every little bit of exposure counts.

6. Do you do pets/custom recolors?
- Yes, in fact I did custom pets for rTO, and will release these once I figure out how to make the proper animation for them (I'm a little lazy). I will do recolors if you ask me to, but honestly, it's really easy and you can do it yourself, I promise! I always recommend people start out with recolors when they're learning how to make fuses for Trickster. Really great way to grasp the dimensions, color limitations, and fundamentals of production.

7. Do you make originals?
- Yes but I'm very scared to release these--they are not very good, and I have not properly exported them yet. I may include them in [this thread](https://forum.ragezone.com/threads/bulk-custom-fuse-release.1243661/) at a future point. I've so far made a 90+ hand-drawn frame "flying pixie" fuse (special head/ears+tail) and a drawn heart animation, but neither are exported to .bmp yet and I am lazy (in actually I'm very busy and constantly adopt/put down projects like a madman). I don't think I will ever do commissioned originals, though--I'm not a fantastic artist.

8. Can you make a tutorial on how to make these, especially en bulk/easily?
- Made a partial tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkyFoCyn_c) on the process, but it does not cover the GM Fuse Tool half of the process or the config, as right now, the one I am using is not mine to distribute, but when I get mine, I probably will be releasing it somewhere in the near future. Additionally, I'm using a template config to align my fuses, but when I figure out how to properly reverse engineer the Hex, I will most likely be posting a tutorial for that, too.

9. How do I preview this, client-side?
- Replace the .nri of a known item (check the itemParam [yes all of them starting with itemParam] databases for the file names to replace if you are lazy using TO Toolbox with your libconfig.xml) with any of the packaged nri's and you should be good to go! It will only show for you, and only whenever you or someone else wears that specific equip. This is how I made the portraits--I would create the fuses, import them to the game, and screenshot my "Happy" character doing the /Happy emote, screenshot it, then re-edit it in Photoshop. There is a less convoluted way of making character previews (extracting one of the nri's in character folder and photoshopping the fuse on it), but I am a very stubborn, convoluted person so I enjoyed my ecclectic process. Plus, it gives it a more personal touch, don't you think?
