# TO-Fuse-Tools-And-Guides
My contributions to the Trickster Fuse Community, including additions to tools, guides, and my personal fuses.

This repository is a collection of community-written tutorials, tools, and fuse assets for customizing Trickster Online character graphics as well as gameplay. It includes beginner-friendly guides, recolor templates, helper scripts, and a bulk release of custom-made fuse parts, as well as guides regarding gameplay such as for Guardian and Sheep.

> **This repo does NOT include full copies of external tools** such as Pyro’s Nori Tool — we only link to those, with credit to their original authors.

## Contents

- `guides/` — Step-by-step instructions on recoloring, exporting/importing fuses, and using tools; additionally, in-game guides I had made for epTO that can apply, with minimal modification, to other servers.
- `scripts/` — Simple `.bat` scripts to streamline repetitive tasks, how to use them, and where to place them.
- `recolors/` — Prebuilt fuse assets (BMP+showcase PNGs+NRI's [although the NRI's might not be properly sorted]) available for public use
- `templatesAndSelfTrackers/` — Some fun stuff for account management and self-pacing. Edit them as you please!
