**run.bat**
- Good if you just want to unpack or view individual files
> Place in main TNT folder, making sure the TNT folder is named "TNT" ONLY (without quotes)
> Double left click, input your args, you're done!

**run_bulk4.bat**
- Only good for extracting bulk NRI's
- Great if you want to extract an entire server's files, or an entire directory without doing C:\...\*.nri (I keep forgetting the *.nri :( )
- It will also delete the empty folders left behind by the encrypted NRI's *for you* so you don't have to worry about cleaning up after.
> Place in main TNT folder, making sure the TNT folder is named "TNT" ONLY (without quotes)
> Double Left Click, Ctrl+V your folder directory (I prefer the Trickster/Data folder so it recurses and does the whole thing), enter, decide if it should do the folders inside as well (recurse), and watch the magic happen!
 

Major thanks to PyroSamurai for the original tool. I just wanted tiny scripts to streamline things and contribute.
