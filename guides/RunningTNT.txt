For anyone struggling, these were my steps:

- Install JDK
- Environment Path to JDK
- Restart
- make manifest.txt in "TNT-master" folder with "Main-Class: Main" (no quotes) for the text
- Rename folder to "TNT" (no quotes)
1. Shift+Rclick to Open Windows Power Shell in that folder
- ".\compile-jar.bat" (no quotes) in windows powershell
2. "java -jar TNT.jar" (no quotes) in windows powershell



Hope this helps someone else. If not, here is my folder and follow 1. and 2. (Shift+Rclick.....& "java -jar....) to run it. Happy extracting :)



Additionally:

If 1. and 2. are too complicated/too many steps for you/scary, I included a run.bat folder (TO-Fuse-Tools-And-Guides/scripts/TNT/run.bat) in this one so you don't have to do step 1 and just have a command prompt open (follow step 2 along with your appropriate arguments). Enjoy!
